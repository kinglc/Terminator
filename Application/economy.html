		<h2>Market Analysis and Data Mining</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="imgleft"><img src="image/economy.jpg"></div>
		<p>Several large financial institutions have invested in AI engines to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and to clients to help with investment decisions. Its wide range of functionalities includes the use of natural language processing to read text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use an AI engine called Sqreem (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) which can mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with the wealth management products they most likely want.Goldman Sachs uses Kensho, a market analytics platform that combines statistical computing with big data and natural language processing. Its machine learning systems mine through hoards of data on the web and assess correlations between world events and their impact on asset prices.Information Extraction, part of artificial intelligence, is used to extract information from live news feed and to assist with investment decisions.</p>

The app can analyze factors such as monthly income, current balance, and spending habits, then make its own decisions and transfer money to the savings account.Wallet.AI, an upcoming startup in San Francisco, builds agents that analyze data that a consumer would leave behind, from Smartphone check-ins to tweets, to inform the consumer about their spending behavior.</p>
